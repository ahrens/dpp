 This milestone is intended for use in situations where importing non-root pools
 causes a kernel panic. Since SSH no longer requires the filesystem/local
 service, this milestone will allow us to boot the system to the point where we
 can ssh (invaluable for debugging in a cloud environment) without going any farther.
